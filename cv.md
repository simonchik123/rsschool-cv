### About me
Hey !
I can't say that I love programming ... But I am firmly convinced that the main and correct vocation of humanity is creation.
Programming for me is the best way to prove myself in creating something useful and cool and, of course, get money for it ;-)

### Skills
At first I studied PHP, from where I got my first idea of working with OOP, frameworks on the MVC model. At the moment, my choice is javascript and I want to grow in this direction.
